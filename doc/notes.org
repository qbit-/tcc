* CPD and nCPD
  I spent a lot of effort to make the normalized CPD ALS work.
  Normalized CPD (nCPD) is 
  t[i, .., n] = sum_{p} lam[p] * X1[i, p] * ... * Xn[n, p]), 
  e.g. vector lam holds weights of the factors, which are normed
  to have unit columns.

  Here are the findings:

  1. With nCPD we can identify zero modes in the weight 
     vector (good). Zero modes occur presumably when the rank
     of nCPD is excessive, e.g. is higher than the maximal rank
     for a tensor of given dimensions.
     Those modes are not easily seen in the usual CPD format.
     
  2. Lambdas can go negative themselves, but forcing them
     to stay positive does not hurt the algorithm. 
     The magnitude of lambdas is UNIQUE (good). 

  3. Convergence of ALS slows down significanly as one approaches
     the true rank of the tensor. However, ALS seem to be 
     pretty robust if given enough iterations

  4. nCPD code is much slower than CPD
